# Archived as there is a [fixed fork](https://github.com/thewriteway/SidebarDiagnostics).
# SidebarDiagnostics 3.5.0
This is repo with fixed standalone version of https://github.com/ArcadeRenegade/SidebarDiagnostics

Newer versions are all flickering. As I don't have a time to search, fix and recompile the newest current version (3.6.3) I've just created this repo with the standalone latest non-flickering [official original compiled version 3.5.0](https://github.com/ArcadeRenegade/SidebarDiagnostics/releases/tag/3.5.0). Get it [here](https://github.com/drlight17/SidebarDiagnostics/releases/latest).

# What is fixed:
- support of new AMD GPUs monitoring (with [Open Hardware Monitor](https://github.com/openhardwaremonitor/openhardwaremonitor) 0.9.6 dll)
- constant flickering if "Reserve Space" is turned on (see related issues from the main repo of the project: https://github.com/ArcadeRenegade/SidebarDiagnostics/issues/375, https://github.com/ArcadeRenegade/SidebarDiagnostics/issues/228, https://github.com/ArcadeRenegade/SidebarDiagnostics/issues/399)
- added the latest language files from the newest current version (3.6.3)

#### No need to install. Just unpack and run. When update error appears click Ok. Saved settings will be in %LOCALAPPDATA%\SidebarDiagnostics\settings.json.
#### I've made it for myself but seeing many people complaining I've decided to make this repo public.
#### Don't update until all above fixes will be in the [latest official release](https://github.com/ArcadeRenegade/SidebarDiagnostics/releases/latest)!
